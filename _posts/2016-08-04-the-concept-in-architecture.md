"Architecture is an expression of values".

-- Norman Foster

The concept in architecture goes beyond aesthetics and function. it has to do with the emotional link between people and their surroundings.

When it comes to design, the understanding of the essence of what you are doing, is what makes the difference from start to end.

**Find your Personality**

More than following a trend, embracing one's personality is more fulfilling than copying others' styles. Your essence will always set you apart and add a unique touch to whatever you do.

I recently figured out that I am in the performance-driven mindset; looking at how good I am doing at something. The downside of taking this behavior to extremes is that you can get rapidly frustrated when compared to others . I have been learning how to balance this attitude so I can be happy with who I am and what I do.

What kind of person are you?

Take a deep breath and think.

**Be a Storyteller**

From the several projects I developed at college, I remember one in particular where we were told to design a house in the forest for 5 people; mom and dad, 1 daughter and 2 boys. Apart from the building program we were not provided with any other information.

So I began to design the house for that family and came across lots of gaps. I didn't even know how old they were and what they did for a living, their likes, hobbies, etc. I stopped drawing lines and started designing the imaginary family.

I went through all the members and assigned them a name, age, activity and personality. I spent a few hours writing how I wanted that family to look like.

Finally, with a broader description of the family requirements and characteristics, I could get to a design solution that would match what they wanted.

When we are to design, it is important to get to know the personality of the users. We have to go further as to knowing what they want. The more information about your clients' attitudes, the more suitable the design approaches will be.

**Emotions drive Form**

If you analyze 3 different cars, you will see that their form is based on, apart from functionality, how their inventors want people to feel.

From my point of view, in architecture the same thing happens, form follows emotions. Your experiences and judgment shape your design ideas into forms that you consider attractive, instead of only be driven by the functionality.

As designers, we have to understand how people feel about spaces; what life-changing events they have been through, so you know how to deal with that and go beyond the function drives form statement.

**Find your Constant**

Along with the art of applying design fundamentals such as rhythm, symmetry, sequence, etc., it is good to have a constant that makes your work stand out.

Take Tadao Ando's formed concrete, for instance, you can find it in all of his work, but although that material is repeated, the constant is his pursue of simplicity, which you can notice by analyzing his buildings.

If I am asked to define my constant, I can say that it is the pursue of the correlation between emotional stability, simplicity and innovation.

Embracing a constant is a good way to make the foundation of your design thinking and play around with it.

**Commit to your Principles**

In the search for a concept, your way of thinking has a tremendous impact on the creation of your ideas.

When you are asked to design a house, you have to take clients' thinking into account, but equally important, your principles. These are the essence of your life and the reason why you do what you do.

## ...

Conceptualizing in architecture is more than just drawing eye-catching buildings, it involves your spirit and leaves an indelible part of yourself in everything you do.

Have fun!
